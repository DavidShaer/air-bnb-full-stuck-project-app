The host was very easy to work with as far as being able to check in early and check out late, which was very appreciated considering we had two babies with us.  The only downside was that there was no AC. Given, it was my fault for not checking the listing, and although I thought we wouldn\\'t survive a night there, you felt a nice cool breeze when you opened both front and back doors so the AC wasn\\'t needed after all.  (One of the neighbors came to yell at me because one of the babies was crying so I had to keep the door shut) The location was perfect! It was walking distance to the very popular breakfast spot \"The Gazebo\" and to the Napili Bay that is very beautiful and you can see turtles.  There were a couple of issues with roaches, but it\\'s inevitable considering they are condos and not everyone that lives in a complex is clean, although the condo was.  We would stay there again '},\n",

Despite there are a lot of people in this Condo Complex (Napili Ridge), we didn't feel the place to be crowdy (as well as elsewhere in Hawaii). While the most interesting activities (IMHO) are in Lahaina, there is just 12-15 min drive. You can drive elsewhere on Maui within 3.5-4 hours (one way).\\n____________________________________________________________________\\nFacilities/Equipment:\\nIt really looks recently renovated, all facilities and equipment are good. There is a fridge, microwave and regular oven, plates and silverware. We enjoyed having breakfast on Patio with a nice garden view. Parking lots are not the issue - you just need to fill the form and submit it to management office.\\n____________________________________________________________________\\nCleanliness:\\nThe place was clean as expected. Host provided to us beach and bathroom towels which was greatly appreciated\\n____________________________________________________________________\\nOverall\\nGreat value-for-money deal for Hawaii travelers who don't want to spend tons of money for vacation.

We drove to Lahaina and/or to/near Kaanapali area most days and although it's a short trip (15 mins?), we didn't mind as it's a beautiful ride. The condo is close to some stores as well! We forgot there was no A/C when we arrived and thought we might get hot overnight but sleeping with the windows open and a fan was perfect for all 3 of us. \"},\n",
